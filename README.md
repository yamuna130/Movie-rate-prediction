# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This project aims to predict movie ratings based on features like **genre**, **director**, **runtime**, and **actors** using **regression models**. Built with Python and deployed using Streamlit, the application provides real-time predictions and insights from the IMDb Indian Movies dataset.
